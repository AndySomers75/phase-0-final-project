                <ul>
                  <li>My name is Andrew or you can call me Andy. I live in Gippsland, Victoria and a father to 2 amazing girls.</li>
                  <li>I am passionate about exploring the great outdooors through travelling and with endurance sports such as trail running, hiking and mountain biking.</li>
                  <li>Majority of my working career has been working for myself in a food distribution, wholesale, manufacturing and storage business covering from Melbourne to the N.S.W border.
                      With all these life experiences I have desired to be albe to create software specifically designed for the Australian market within the outdoor/recreation/fitness/sport industry.
                      Over many years I have used programs that lack user functionality or poor design and have resulted in many occasions coming unstuck. I am looking to use my passion for fitness and the outdoors 
                      to partner and collaborate my ideas into a complete outdoor navigation and fitness software app. So how do I get there.?
