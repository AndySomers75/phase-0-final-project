        <h3>History of Me</h3>
                  <p>My name is Andrew or you can call me Andy. I have lived in Gippsland, Victoria for over 40 years, having moved to Townsville to study, Perth to just get away and China for work.
                    I am a proud father 2 to daugthers and in total a parent to 4 amazing kids.</p>
             
            
        <h3>What I do for fun!</h3>
                    <p>I am passionate about travelling and competing in endurance sports such as trail running and hiking the mountain ranges throughout Australia.
                       I have travelled to the U.S, Japan, Bali, France, Fiji, China and experienced many beautiful sites. 
                    </p>
              
        <h3>Career</h3>
                    <p> Most of my working career has been working for myself in a food distribution, wholesale, manufacturing and storage business covering from Melbourne to the N.S.W border.
                        Within my 20 years of owning a business the businesses growth was a continually need to evolve in technology and software. Over this time I lead, assisted and gained a interest in how software integrates and have always been fascinated to know more.
                        I have also worked in the fitness industry in China as a manager in the largest "indoor spa" resort in the world, which was amazing!
                    </p>

            <h2>Ambition to Learn Programming</h2>

                <p>Outside of work my life experiences within the outdoor recreation space I have a enourmous desire to be albe to create software specifically designed for the Australian market within the outdoor/recreation/fitness/sport industry.
            Over many years I have used programs that lack user functionality or poor design and have resulted in many occasions coming unstuck. I am looking to use my passion for fitness and the outdoors 
            to partner and collaborate my ideas into a complete outdoor navigation and fitness software app.</p>
            So how do I get there.?
