                <h3>What I do for fun!</h3>
                    <p>I am passionate about travelling and competing in endurance sports such as trail running and hiking the mountain ranges throughout Australia.
                       I have travelled to the U.S, Japan, Bali, France, Fiji, China and experienced many beautiful sites.

                <h3>Career</h3>
                    <p>Most of my working career has been working for myself in a food distribution, wholesale, manufacturing and storage business covering from Melbourne to the N.S.W border.
                      Within my 20 years of owning a business the businesses growth was a continually need to evolve in technology and software. Over this time I lead, assisted and gained a interest in how software integrates and have always been fascinated to know more.
                    I have also worked in the fitness industry in China as a manager in the largest "indoor spa" resort in the world, which was amazing!

            </article>         
                      Outside of work my life experiences within the outdoor recreation space I have a enourmous desire to be albe to create software specifically designed for the Australian market within the outdoor/recreation/fitness/sport industry.
                      Over many years I have used programs that lack user functionality or poor design and have resulted in many occasions coming unstuck. I am looking to use my passion for fitness and the outdoors 
                      to partner and collaborate my ideas into a complete outdoor navigation and fitness software app. So how do I get there.?
